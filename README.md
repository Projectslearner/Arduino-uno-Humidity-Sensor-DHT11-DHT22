# Arduino Uno Humidity Sensor (DHT11)

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a DHT11 humidity sensor with an Arduino Uno to measure the relative humidity in the environment. The sensor provides digital output that is read by the Arduino, and the humidity value is displayed on the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **DHT11 Humidity Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the DHT11 Humidity Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - **Signal pin of the DHT11 Sensor:** Connect to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - **Vcc pin of the DHT11 Sensor:** Connect to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - **GND pin of the DHT11 Sensor:** Connect to GND on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the DHT11 humidity sensor to the Arduino Uno as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Library Installation:**
   - If not already installed, download and install the DHT sensor library in the Arduino IDE. This library provides functions to interact with DHT sensors.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output displaying the humidity readings.

#### Applications

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Use in projects that require monitoring and controlling humidity levels.
- **Home Automation:** Integrate with home automation systems for climate control.
- **Plant Monitoring:** Implement in projects related to plant health and growth monitoring.

#### Notes

- Ensure the DHT11 sensor is correctly connected to the Arduino Uno and powered.
- The DHT sensor library simplifies communication with the sensor and provides reliable humidity readings.
- Calibrate the sensor as necessary based on your specific environmental conditions.
