# Humidity Monitoring with Buzzer Alarm

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to monitor the humidity level in the environment. When the humidity drops below 50%, an alarm buzzer is activated to alert the user.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
3. **Buzzer**
4. **Resistor (if required for Buzzer)**
5. **Breadboard**
6. **Jumper Wires**

#### Circuit Wiring

1. **DHT11 Sensor:**
   - Connect the data pin of the DHT11 sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino.

2. **Buzzer:**
   - Connect the positive terminal of the buzzer to digital pin 5 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the buzzer to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Assemble the circuit according to the wiring instructions.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and components are correctly placed on the breadboard.

2. **Monitor Humidity Levels:**
   - The DHT11 sensor continuously monitors the humidity level in the environment.

3. **Buzzer Alarm:**
   - When the humidity drops below 50%, the buzzer alarm is activated.
   - The buzzer alarm is turned off when the humidity reaches 50% or above.

#### Applications

- **Indoor Climate Monitoring:** Use the system to monitor humidity levels in indoor environments.
- **Plant Care:** Alert users when the humidity drops below optimal levels for plant growth.
- **Sensitive Equipment Protection:** Protect sensitive equipment by monitoring and controlling humidity levels.
